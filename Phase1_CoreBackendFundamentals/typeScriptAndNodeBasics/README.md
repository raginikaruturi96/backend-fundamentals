# TypeScript and Node Basics

## TypeScript

TypeScript is the superset of the javascript.

### How typescript different for the javascript?
Typescript enforces type rules in our Javascript code. This allows us to catch any potential errors during development and avoid going live with dozens of errors in the console.

### Difference between typescript node project and general node project
- Javascript is used in the general node project where as typescript is used in typscript node project
- TypeScript files requires a transpilation step (using the tsc compiler) to convert .ts files into .js files that Node.js can execute.

> `npx` is often used to run the tsc command if TypeScript is installed as a local dependency in your project. It finds the tsc executable within your project's node_modules/.bin directory and runs it, saving you from needing a global installation.
